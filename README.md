# Street-View-Hyperlapse---Frame-Interpolation---Novel-View-Synthesis
This project focuses on Novel View Synthesis and frame interpolation applied to Street View imagery. The goal is to generate realistic intermediate frames between two discrete geographical points, creating a smooth forward-motion effect that simulates continuous navigation using deep learning and depth estimation techniques.
